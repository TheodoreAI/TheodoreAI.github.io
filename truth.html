      I think that what I did with Ari and then with Kasey along with the trail of messages to other girls over the course of time that we were together last year.
      They were all moments of moral weakness from my part. The sad part is that moments of moral weakness are also what began our relationship.
      Of us sleeping together even though we knew we shouldn't because we were roommates, we were friends, and most importantly we loved each other as such.
      I see now that it was a mistake to let that slip from the beginning. Too long had I wondered what it was that felt wrong and
      unsteady between us, and it was because of how it all started.
      I feel like I didn't give you the respect you deserved as a woman, and I felt like you didn't give me that same respect.
      Perhaps it was because we weren't mean or woman yet. We were just flings and casual sex.

      I don't think I was ready to be in a relationship, even if it was with you. I didn't understand the value, meaning, and significance that it had fully.
      But we were attempting to be brave and bold and defy the social norms that we believed were wrong.
      But I was lost, I don't know if it was because I still had much to learn and discover, with regards to my morality.
      I think it does, and heres why (and I don't think I came up with this idea, it's similar to Raskolnikov): as an Athiest,
      I didn't believe in moral consequences to my actions. Therefore, whatever I did and whomever I did it with,
      did not matter in the slightest, so long as there was pleasure and some passing happiness and I could always lie to avoid the pain. This all fuleded by my resentment
      with life for how my family is, how I was raised, and just a lot of unprocessed human emotions inside me.
      Immature is a word that only begins  to describe how I acted and behaved with you. I thought I could willfully drive myself out of the
      world of being a "fuck boy", for that is what I was when we started dating (Angel was right).
      But I realized that I still was one even when we were together. I felt cursed because I had brought that upon myself,
      and I had failed to realize how much confusion and lies it would bring upon me and the people around me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have lied, cheated, and hurt you. And you still say that you love me and that you want to be with me.
      Some would call that stupidity, others would call it true love.
      Most would call it both. But I think that there are a lot of things between us that have to be resolved if we are to
      continue growing together. I fear that as I write this, I finally am giving myself the chance to be honest with you,
      even if it hurts you. But I believe the truth will save us. Whether we end up together or not.
      When Ari was here, and I was talking to her. She asked me if I was happy with you.
      And I told her that I was confused. We talked, and when you called I told her to please get out of my car cause I had to get home
      and call you, but she wouldn't leave. She looked at me and she asked me what was wrong, I was sad and in pain.
      She could see it in my eyes that what we had done was still undelt within me. That I felt like I owed you for the pain
      I caused you. And its true, I felt like I do. And in the process of owing that debt I feel like my love for you romantically has
      suffered. I feel like I don't love you romantically like I should.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not sure how to get it back, but I do believe telling you this is part of it.
      Whether it begins to grow or not, I will give it a chance. I want to give it a chance for myself and you.
      Because I think it also has to do with me getting my "soul" back.
      I want you to know this. I also want you to know that if I can't get it back,
      we will have to end things. But I want you to know that just like how you didn't give up on me easily,
      I won't give up on you so easily. Because you make me happy, and you push me in the right ways.
      I just need to find your heart and my own. And if it happened once, theres hope.
      So in the name of beginning that dorky and cheesy process:
