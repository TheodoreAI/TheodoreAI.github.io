    <p>
      I have hurt you. And you still say that you love me and that you want to be with me.
      Some would call that stupidity, others would call it true love.
      Most would call it both. But I think that there are a lot of things between us that have to be resolved if we are to
      continue growing together. I fear that as I write this, I finally am giving myself the chance to be honest with you,
      even if it hurts you. But I believe the truth will save us. Whether we end up together or not.
      When Ari was here, and I was talking to her. She asked me if I was happy with you.
      And I told her that I was confused. We talked, and when you called I told her to please get out of my car cause I had to get home
      and call you, but she wouldn't leave. She looked at me and she asked me what was wrong, I was sad and in pain.
      She could see it in my eyes that what we had done was still undelt within me. That I felt like I owed you for the pain
      I caused you. And its true, I felt like I do. And in the process of owing that debt I feel like my love for you romantically has
      suffered. I feel like I don't love you romantically like I should, I feel like in the past months I have been forcing myself to make the sparks start,
      I don't know if they will.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not sure how to get it back, but I do believe telling you this is part of it.
      Whether it begins to grow or not, I will give it a chance. I want to give it a chance for myself and you.
      Because I think it also has to do with me getting my "soul" back. I say that because it's more than just about being romantic,
      its also about feeling compassion, forgivenss, emotions, and the joys that I long for. There is one thing that I know for sure though,
      every time I listen to the Killers, I won't be able to help it but think of you. And I see that as embers.
      I want you to know this. I also want you to know that if I can't get it back,
      we will have to end things. But I want you to know that just like how you didn't give up on me easily,
      I won't give up on you easily. Because you make me happy, and you push me in the right ways.
      I just need to find your heart and my own. And if it happened once, theres hope.
      So in the name of continuing that dorky and cheesy process:
