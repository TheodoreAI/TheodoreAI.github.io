    <p>Four years ago and eleven months. I met this one girl, she was cool. She was funny, empathetic, energetic, and full of life.
    I was instantly attracted to her. Like lil plantitas to the sunlight. The next couple of months were tough for her.
    She lost someone that no one could ever replace. She went dark, and it was difficult seeing her like that.
    Whom I had met was slowly becoming heartbroken and questioned her very existance and the fairness of life. Needless to say I
    witnessed a lot of tears and pain in the name of loss. I never knew what to say. There really aren't words. There is only the silence which acknowledges the bridge
    that is human empathy. Now I see someone new. Not the old happy Yesenia I met. A different one, one that has had plenty of battle scars and wounds.
    Things which dig deep into the human heart and spirit. But I also see potential. It's cliche, but I do believe that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. In my case it made me stranger,
    but thats beside the point. For you it has tapped a drive to live life to the fullest cause you never know when it'll be over. I can see it in your eyes. I hear it in your voice, your writing, and I can feel it when I'm with you.
     </p>
    <p>For the cheap price of shoving it down your pants.</p>
    <p> I see you. I've seen you for a while. I'm going to tell you how I see you. I see people, when we are in a group, I don't necessarily look at the person talking, I look at the people around. Looking for signs of change.
    People's fascial experssions and truth is so evident and revealing in their faces. You can read the people that have no chance to think before something unusual is said to them. When confronted with a new situation, you can tell when people lie.
  I feel like the reason why I know is because I'm really good at lying. People's hidden desires lie at the surface of those who feel some sort of guilt. Maybe a memory is what is at the surface of the frontal cortex, their face will light up, change their smile, squint their eyes, switch their speech patter, or falter.
Ever so slightly ever so cautious. Lying is an art, and people, regular people are bad at it. I am good at it, mostly because I can even lie to myself. </p>
