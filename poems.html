    "As time goes by"
  </h1>
  <div class="textarea">
  <p>About four years and eleven months ago. I met this one girl, she was cool. She was funny, empathetic, energetic, and full of life.
    I was instantly attracted to her. Like lil plantitas to the sunlight. The next couple of months were tough for her.
    She lost someone that no one could ever replace. She went dark, and it was difficult seeing her like that.
    Whom I had met was slowly becoming heartbroken and questioned her very existance and the fairness of life. Needless to say I
    witnessed a lot of tears and pain in the name of loss. I never knew what to say. There really aren't words. There is only the silence which acknowledges the bridge
    that is human empathy. Now I see someone new. Not the old happy Yesenia I met. A different one, one that has had plenty of battle scars and wounds.
    Things which dig deep into the human heart and spirit. But I also see potential. It's cliche, but I do believe that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. In my case it made me stranger,
    but thats beside the point. For you it has tapped a drive to live life to the fullest cause you never know when it'll be over. I can see it in your eyes. I hear it in your voice, your writing, and I can feel it when I'm with you.
  </p>
  <p>"For the cheap price of shoving it down your pants" - Paloma (my favorite quote)</p>
  <p> I see you. I've seen you for a while. I'm going to tell you how I see you. I see people, when we are in a group, I don't necessarily look at the person talking, I look at the people around. Looking for signs of change.
    People's fascial experssions and truth are sometimes evident and reveal what is inside them on their faces. You can read the people that have no chance to think before something unusual is said to them. When confronted with a new situation, you can tell when people lie.
    I feel like the reason why I know is because I'm really good at lying. People's hidden desires lie at the surface of those who feel some sort of guilt. Maybe a memory is what is at the surface of the frontal cortex, their face will light up,
    change their smile, squint their eyes, switch their speech patter, or falter.
    Ever so slightly ever so cautious. Lying is an art, and people, most people are bad at it. I am good at it, mostly because I can even lie to myself. </p>

  <h2>Beginnings</h2>
    <p>
    This past year was full of surprises.
    Of happiness and sadness, of being broke and being high. There have been moments of weakness, and of strength.

    The year I've learned what it means to feel human, to be flawed, to want to be better and progressively do so. Things rarely change so abruptly, specially when it gets to matters of personality.

    I've seen myself slowly lose the walls I've built around me. I think there are moments in my life where I've been afraid of learning the consequences, where I'd rather lie than face the truth. I've thought about how it would hurt you to know the
    truth of mistakes I've made, and I have hurt you, but I think I've hurt myself the most.

    This past summer I messed up academically, I was found responsible for plaigarism in my intro to CS class. Last project, and I had to go through it again and take a course and write essays where I basically thought about what I did and why I did
    it. I think this was a last draw for me.

    The thing that finally made me realize that where I was going and what I was doing to get there was wrong. The sad part was that it was a dumb assignment, I know I could have done it, but I was lazy and I wanted to hangout with you those last
    moments when we were canyoneering.
  </p>
  <p>
    Big mistake, because what happened was a chain effect that shook my entire life, I lost scholarships for the fall term, I had to pay out of pocket for retaking CS161, at one point I thought about quitting and going back to physics, but I knew
    that was just me cowering and not owning up to my mistakes. So I retook the class with the same instructor and I got an -A (so close except that damn last assignment that I just didn't do justice, is okay though, the professor said what I was
    doing was creative it just needed a little extra connection with the overall program).

    But I've been broke, I had -$63.52 in my bank account the other day. I thought UPS was going to help right away but even their process of scholarship is tardy and I couldn't get a refund from the plane tickets, and it's been rough just nothing
    going my way or according to plan at the end of last year.

    I think what has kept me going has been hanging out with Chava and his family. Talking to you and playing games with you, and getting high sometimes and just listen to music and think about what my life has become.

    But to be honest, I've never felt more free. When we talked about Ari and I told you what happened and I just felt like my humanity was returning. I think the highlight was being Santa Claus and taking a gift to my dad even though I am hella
    broke. That was the best.

    I sought the help of my old therapist, but I stopped emailing her, I just don't like her cause she's extremely unreliable and takes forever to reply.
    So meditation has been something that has allowed me to take a step back and look at my life from a perspective that is differnt.
    The first real glimpse I got was a burned forest filled with pain. So here's how I felt:  </p>
    As I ran through my mind, I looked and I felt, I was living within without much thought, only instinct and a quietness of my propensity to judge and categorize.

    I raced my thoughts side by side, looking at them, and attempting to see where they were coming from, where they were going, and what they contained.

    Where they came was a moving environment, a collection of information in the form of images, gifs, videos, words, memories, names, they all danced together and they became a mixture.

    Where they went was to my awareness, and it's difficult to successfully pay attention to what the data that was sent to my awareness was meant to represent and therefore initiate a thought and also suggest an action.

    What they contained was a mixture of feelings, thoughts, expressions, facts about physics, my beliefs, and a darker mixture of unknown substance but which I simply associate with the unknown feelings that reside within.

    I followed these and to a dark forest I stumbled. The forest is a metaphysical place I imagined to picture what I saw and felt, perhaps instigated by the forest we saw and stopped by on our way to the hot springs. It was burned to a crisp, I fear
    that the topsoil might also be burnt of all life. I hope not, I believe it will take a lifetime to let the forest fully grow. I hope not, but I do hope that as time goes on, my life experiences will one day germinate this once wild forest.</p>
    <p> I fear that the feelings described by the words above might be shadowed by the run-on sentences (Mrs. Jones would be dissapointed).

<div class="textarea">


  <p><b>I hope these moments continue, no matter what, because the truth is that I love you like I've never loved anyone before.</b>

  I don't mean to be dramatic when I say that I love you like I've never loved anyone, cause I have loved people before.
  I still do to some extent, I love my family, I love my friends, I love Ari, I love my cousin, and I love you.
  I'm not sure 100% how I love you. But I feel like this:


  I can’t live without you in my life, helping me, guiding, teaching me, learning from, and showing up with.
  I see life is an adventure with you.
  Because every time I’m with you, I can’t help but feel like a kid in a new park.
  Waiting to explore, waiting to see the world as you see it, as I saw it as a kid, and live free.
  I want to impress you and I want you to be impressed by me.
  When we went canyoneering, I felt like I had to be the one to take the leaps first.
  Be brave and show that even though I am fearful and aware of my own mortality,
  I can still do things beyond what I felt possible of doing.

  But I feel uncertain about the future,
  And I've been thinking about why. For the past couple of months, I have been trying to put myself together again.
  It has been difficult, I never realized how much damage to my own soul I could inflict with my carelessness.
  It became perfectly evident when I saw the pain in your eyes when you found out what I had done. What you will read next is not easy,
  its not easy for me to say and admit. And I know it won't be easy for you to read.
  However, I have reached the end of a fatal sprint. I cannot contain what I hold inside my mind and heart.
  In order for me to begin loving again as I once did with innocence and passion, I must restore myself.
  I think the only way to do so is by saying my truth. Whether that strengthens us or destroys us, well, I think that will be up to us.

  <p>
    Sometimes, in my quietest moments, I do think about how healthy I am, mentally.
    I have realized that for so long I wasn't able to let go of Ari because she was like a therapist to me.
    I told her everything, and even though I broke up with her, I couldn't quite let her go.
    I feel like this time I don't know if I am meant to be with you till death do us part.
    It's a strange feeling I have, one would say it's a heartache.
    I feel like my romantic sense has slipped from me.
    I hear romantic music and yet I don't feel like I used to when I was younger.
    I don't know what it is, I have been nervous to tell you because I dont want you to feel like I am giving up.
    I dont want to give up on us, but I don't know where my romance is. Maybe I've changed.
    Maybe I have changed, I feel like I don't see romance as I used to.
    Maybe we've been together for long enough that my heart is changing to a more mature version of love.
    Maybe I'm getting my romantic views mixed up, I just want you to be aware and I want to talk to you about that.
    And don't get me wrong, I care and love you (otherwise I wouldn't be doing this corny thing ;p).
    I just want some patience and understanding.
  </p>
