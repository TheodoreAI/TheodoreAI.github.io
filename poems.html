    Poems
  </h1>
  <p>Four years ago and eleven months. I met this one girl, she was cool. She was funny, empathetic, energetic, and full of life.
    I was instantly attracted to her. Like lil plantitas to the sunlight. The next couple of months were tough for her.
    She lost someone that no one could ever replace. She went dark, and it was difficult seeing her like that.
    Whom I had met was slowly becoming heartbroken and questioned her very existance and the fairness of life. Needless to say I
    witnessed a lot of tears and pain in the name of loss. I never knew what to say. There really aren't words. There is only the silence which acknowledges the bridge
    that is human empathy. Now I see someone new. Not the old happy Yesenia I met. A different one, one that has had plenty of battle scars and wounds.
    Things which dig deep into the human heart and spirit. But I also see potential. It's cliche, but I do believe that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. In my case it made me stranger,
    but thats beside the point. For you it has tapped a drive to live life to the fullest cause you never know when it'll be over. I can see it in your eyes. I hear it in your voice, your writing, and I can feel it when I'm with you.
  </p>
  <p>For the cheap price of shoving it down your pants.</p>
  <p> I see you. I've seen you for a while. I'm going to tell you how I see you. I see people, when we are in a group, I don't necessarily look at the person talking, I look at the people around. Looking for signs of change.
    People's fascial experssions and truth is so evident and revealing in their faces. You can read the people that have no chance to think before something unusual is said to them. When confronted with a new situation, you can tell when people lie.
    I feel like the reason why I know is because I'm really good at lying. People's hidden desires lie at the surface of those who feel some sort of guilt. Maybe a memory is what is at the surface of the frontal cortex, their face will light up,
    change their smile, squint their eyes, switch their speech patter, or falter.
    Ever so slightly ever so cautious. Lying is an art, and people, regular people are bad at it. I am good at it, mostly because I can even lie to myself. </p>
  <h2>Beginnings</h2>
  <p>See if you can buy land in Oregon (along coast, or forest)
    If possible, do it. Investment on land.

    This year has been full of surprises.
    Of happiness and sadness, of being broke and being high. There have been moments of weakness, and of strength.

    This year I've learned what it means to feel human, to be flawed, to want to be better and progressively do so. Things rarely change so abruptly, specially when it gets to matters of personality.

    I've seen myself slowly lose the walls I've built around me. I think there are moments in my life where I've been afraid of learning the consequences, where I'd rather lie than face the truth. I've thought about how it would hurt you to know the
    truth of mistakes I've made, and I have hurt you, but I think I've hurt myself the most.

    This past summer i messed up academically, I was found responsible for plaigarism in my intro to CS class. Last project, and I had to go through it again and take a course and write essays where I basically thought about what I did and why I did
    it. I think this was a last draw for me.

    The thing that finally made me realize that where I was going and what I was doing to get there was wrong. The sad part was that it was a dumb assignment, I know I could have done it, but I was lazy and I wanted to hangout with you those last
    moments when we were canyoneering.

    Big mistake, because what happened was a chain effect that shook my entire life, I lost scholarships for the fall term, I had to pay out of pocket for retaking CS161, at one point I thought about quitting and going back to physics, but I knew
    that was just me cowering and not owning up to my mistakes. So I retook the class with the same instructor and I got an -A (so close except that damn last assignment that I just didn't do justice, is okay though, the professor said what I was
    doing was creative it just needed a little extra connection with the overall program).

    But I've been broke, I had -$63.52 in my bank account the other day. I thought UPS was going to help right away but even their process of scholarship is tardy and I couldn't get a refund from the plane tickets, and it's been rough just nothing
    going my way or according to plan this end of the year.

    I think what has kept me through it has been hanging out with chava and his family. Talking to you and playing games with you, and getting high sometimes and just listen to music and think about what my life has become.

    But to be honest, I've never felt more free. When we talked about Ari and I told you what happened and I just felt like my humanity was returning. I think the highlight was being santa Claus and taking a gift to my dad even though I am hella
    broke. That was the best.

    I sought the help of therapist, but I stopped emailing her, I just don't like her cause she's extremely unreliable and takes forever to reply.
    So meditation has been something that has allowed me to take a step back and look at my life from a perspective that isn't tried to how I see the world with my own eyes.

    The first real glimpse I got was a burned forest filled with pain. So here's a poem that describes what it felt like and what it seemed like. To be fair, I'm not sure I understand everything, all I know is that I have to write it.

    As I ran through my mind, I looked and I felt, I was living within without much thought, only instinct and a quietness of my propensity to judge and categorize.

    I raced my thoughts side by side, looking at them, and attempting to see where they were coming from, where they were going, and what they contained.

    Where they came was a moving environment, a collection of information in the form of images, gifs, videos, words, memories, names, they all danced together and they sent out a mixture of all.

    Where they went was to my awareness, and it's difficult to successfully pay attention to what the data that was sent to my awareness was meant to represent and therefore initiate a thought and also suggest an action.

    What they contained was a mixture of feelings, thoughts, expressions, facts about physics, my beliefs, and a darker mixture of unknown substance but which I simply associate with the unknown feelings that reside within.

    I followed these and to a dark forest I stumbled. The forest is a metaphysical place I imagined to picture what I saw and felt, perhaps instigated by the forest we saw and stopped by on our way to the hot springs. It was burned to a crisp, I fear
    that the topsoil might also be burnt of all life. I hope not, I believe it will take a lifetime to let the forest grow. I hope not, but I do hope that as time goes on, my life experiences will one day germinate this once wild forest.</p>
