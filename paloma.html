   <h2>Forget about making a mixtape, this is...

     Making you a website of who you are to me, and most importantly, who you are to the world. </p>

   <p>Four years ago and eleven months. I met this one girl, she was cool. She was funny, empathetic, energetic, and full of life.
   I was instantly attracted to her. Like lil plantitas to the sunlight. The next couple of months were tough for her. 
 She lost someone that no one could ever replace. She went dark, and it was difficult seeing her like that.
Whom I had met was slowly becoming heartbroken and questioned her very existance and the fairness of life. Needless to say I
witnessed a lot of tears and pain in the name of loss. I never knew what to say. There really aren't words. There is only the silence which acknowledges the bridge
that is human empathy. Now I see someone new. Not the old happy Yesenia I met. A different one, one that has had plenty of battle scars and wounds.
Things which dig deep into the human heart and spirit. But I also see potential. It's cliche, but I do believe that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. In my case it made me stranger,
but thats beside the point. For you it has tapped a drive to live life to the fullest cause you never know when it'll be over. I can see it in your eyes. I hear it in your voice, your writing, and I can feel it when I'm with you.
